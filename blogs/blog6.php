Essentially I am just including external files under a loop so every time I add a new file, the code will add it to this page. I will need to devise some way to add multiple pages and keep the newest blog at the top, but this will work for now! Maybe I will get around to getting the source code on here once the program has developed a bit. First blog entry out!</p>';
